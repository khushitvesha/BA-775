# 🏎️ Formula 1 Racing Performance Analysis

This project explores publicly available Formula 1 World Championship data to uncover key insights into driver and constructor performance over time. Using Python-based EDA and visualizations, the analysis reveals patterns and trends that contribute to success in the sport.

---

## 📌 Objective
To analyze historical Formula 1 data and identify the metrics that influence race outcomes — enhancing understanding for fans, analysts, and stakeholders.

---

## 📂 Data Source
- Kaggle: [Formula 1 World Championship Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Includes data on race results, drivers, constructors, circuits, and standings.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Tableau (interactive dashboard)

---

## ⚙️ Data Processing
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Encoded categorical features (e.g., driver, team)
- Normalized numeric fields for clean visualizations

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key questions addressed:
- Which drivers have the most race wins?
- How have constructors evolved over the years?
- What attributes are common among top drivers?

Visualizations were used to uncover trends in:
- Driver performance
- Team dominance
- Seasonal competitiveness

---

## 📈 Interactive Dashboard
An interactive **Tableau dashboard** was created to visualize:
- Team wins by year
- Driver podiums
- Constructor comparisons

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Certain constructors dominate across decades, while some rise/fall due to regulation or driver changes.
- Age, experience, and team affiliation significantly influence race outcomes.
- Podium finishes strongly correlate with constructor performance.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Missing/incomplete values in some seasons
- External race-day factors (weather, crashes, etc.) not included
- No predictive modeling (future enhancement)

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add race-day weather, pit stop, and qualifying data
- Develop predictive models (e.g., podium forecasting)
- Compare pre- and post-regulation eras
